# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code (2019) :christmas_tree:
This repository contains Python solutions to the 2019 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019). Given that I had
already completed a number of these puzzles in 2020, this repository will mostly contain problems I either hadn't tackled 
or wanted to revisit.
