# Advent of Code (2019)
This repository contains Python solutions to the 2019 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019). I had
already completed a number of these puzzles in 2020 and so am using this repo to revisit some days I had trouble
doing the first time around.

| Day | Description | Solution |
| --- | -------| -----| 
| [14](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/14)  | Fuel processing using a list of recipes. | [:star::star:](https://github.com/IAjimi/AdventOfCode2020/blob/master/2019/AOC14.py) | 
| [18](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/18) | Key maze. Path finding with requirements (need to collect keys to open doors). | [:star::star:](https://github.com/IAjimi/AdventOfCode2020/blob/master/2019/AOC18.py) |
